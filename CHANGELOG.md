# Safekeeper changelog

## v0.5.2

- Backup list animates as backups are added or removed
- Smoother everywhere: new screens, tabs and Settings ease in instead of snapping, and buttons, tabs, chips and switches give a light tap you can feel (following your phone's touch-feedback setting)
- Android's predictive back: the back gesture shows a live preview of where you're going
- Super look: tap sparkles now match Bliss Player: soft glowing sparks with trails, drifting rainbow colours and a faint aurora, instead of big solid circles

## v0.5.1

- Much faster and smoother: the app is now built optimised (the way Play Store apps are), so screens open quicker, scrolling is fluid and the APK is about a quarter of the size
- Screens and lists no longer decode pictures on the main thread, and skip redrawing parts that didn't change

## v0.5.0

- Fixed a crash when two backups had the same name
- Works properly in landscape: tabs move to a rail at the side so the content keeps its height, and screens that ran out of room now scroll
- If the app ever crashes it says so next time it opens and offers to send a report (only the error, app version and phone model, with file names and links removed). Turn on automatic sending in Control Room › Wonderdesk
- Lists can no longer crash when two items share a name

## v0.4.0

- Polish and stability fixes from the suite-wide test pass
- If the app ever crashes or freezes, a report goes to Control Room so it can be shared and fixed
- App icon art is larger and fills its tile without being cut off

## v0.3.1

- App icon redrawn so nothing is cut off: round icons fill the space, the rest sit on an Aqua tile
- Smoother and lighter on the battery: the window background no longer animates, tap effects sleep until you tap, and nothing ticks while the app is in the background
- Opening the app no longer waits on Control Room to read the suite look

## v0.3.0

- Automatic, scheduled snapshots of your folders
- Verified ZIP backups and mirrors with restore
